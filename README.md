# Machine-Learning_HandwrittenDigitRecognition
Purpose:
A machine learning program which is able to recognize and predict handwritten digits to a 98% accuracy. Includes a pygame drawing pad where you can manually draw digits, and have real time digit prediction!

Code Description:
The main.ipynb file does the data pre-processing and builds the convolution neural network. It trains and tests the model "bestmodel.h5".
Run main.ipynb first.

The app.py file uses the model we just made "bestmodel.h5" and creates a pygame writing pad with manual entry and live predictio of digits.
