# Machine Learning - Handwritten Digit Recognition
### by Remy Zhang
## About The Project

A machine learning program which is able to recognize and predict handwritten digits to a 98% accuracy. Includes a pygame drawing pad where you can manually draw digits, and have real time digit prediction!


### Built With

* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Pygame
* Numpy
* Pandas
* CONDA Distribution Pack
* Python 3.9
* VS Code

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Before running main.ipynb or app.py, make sure to open requirements.txt and create an virtual environment. After creating the virtual environment, "pip install" all the python packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

The main.ipynb file does the data pre-processing and builds the convolution neural network. It trains and tests the model "bestmodel.h5".
Run main.ipynb first.

The app.py file uses the model we just made "bestmodel.h5" and creates a pygame writing pad with manual entry and live prediction of digits.

### Prerequisites

* venv
  ```sh
  venv\Scripts\activate -g
* Keras
  ```sh
  pip install Keras -g
* Numpy
  ```sh
  pip install Numpy -g
